Game Play
-------------
A person is drowning trying to scream for help. You are Poseidon. Save them from running out of air. Use your trident (left click and drag) to draw currents and guide the "help bubbles" to the correct quadrant. While playing the game, hit the space button to delete your currents. Watch out for the rocks. They will pop the "help" bubbles. Hit the escape key at any point (now or in the game) to return to the main menu. Hit the r key to restart the game.
